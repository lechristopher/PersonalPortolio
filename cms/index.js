	background: 'I am currently a professional Full Stack Web Developer after taking UCLA\'s  Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. Attended UC Berkeley and graduated with a degree in Political Economy. Started my career in software sales with various tech companies and then transitioned over to customer support for a fin-tech start up.\n\nI decided to learn how to code because I want to stay in tune with technology and the ever changing world. I truly believe that one day, the world will be so immersed in technology that everyone will depend on it in ways that we couldn\'t possibly imagine - I want to be the builder of those types of experiences. Eventually, I want to use my technical and entrepreneurial skills to get into product and build beautiful user experiences for people.',
